To reduce the number of adjustable parameters it is suitable to chose $\mathbf{P}_0$ to be dependent
on $\mathbf{Q}$.

As you can see the tuning is quite good as the observer converges quickly to the real state values.
Thereby the convergence might also be achieved by even smaller entries of $\mathbf{Q}$, but
the error dynamic would not be that fast. On the other hand, greater entries of $\mathbf{Q}$
lead to faster observer reactions by which the measurement noise gets amplified
and the state trajectories are fluctuating around their values.
