This numerical error is not corrected by the observer for the tuning chosen in the pervious step. The performance of the observer can be improved by changing the tuning parameters of the EKF. 

The ratios $\mathbf{Q}(2,2)/\mathbf{R}(1,1),\,\mathbf{Q}(3,3)/\mathbf{R}(2,2)$ are less than one, meaning that we trust the model more than the measurements as it is assumed that the model noise is "smaller" than the measurement noise. Therefore the correction done by the observer is too weak to compensate the bad numerical solution at point $k+1$. Changing the tuning to $\mathbf{Q}(2,2)/\mathbf{R}(1,1),\,\mathbf{Q}(3,3)/\mathbf{R}(2,2) > 1$ make the observed states follow the measured values.
