<strong> Fixed gain and gain scheduled observer </strong>

<u> Advantages </u> 
- Low effort for design 
- Less computational time

<u> Disadvantages </u>
- Uses linearized model 
- Difficult to tune 
- Only valid around the operating point

<strong>  Extended Kalman filter (EKF) </strong>

<u> Advantages </u> 
- Easy to design
- Satisfactory performance if the system is not highly nonlinear
- Tuning is difficult but better compared to Fixed gain and gain scheduled observer

<u> Disadvantages </u>
- Uses linearized model
- Instability may occur

<strong> Moving horizon estimation </strong>

<u> Advantages </u> 
- Solves an optimization problem
- Uses full nonlinear model
- Additional constraints can be added
    
<u> Disadvantages </u>
- Numerically demanding
- Requires tuning

<strong> Particle filter   </strong>

- Probability based technique

<u> Advantages </u> 
- No assumption on state and measurement noise 
- Uses full nonlinear model

<u> Disadvantages </u> 
- High computational time  \newline
- Tuning is difficult

<strong>  Unscented Kalman filter </strong>

<u> Advantages </u> 
- Easy to design
- Satisfactory performance when compared to EKF if the system is highly nonlinear
- Tuning difficulty similar EKF

<u> Disadvantages </u>
- Instability may occur
