The issue in having only discrete measurements (which is in principle the case for all measurements) is, that no continuous measurement update of the observer system is possible. Between two sampling points the state values depend only on the simulation of the model (prediction), along with plant model mismatch as well as numerical errors have an influence on the observer behavior. The choice of the numerical method which is used to solve the differential equations is therefore an important factor. Here the simple forward difference method (explicit Euler) was applied to the system to discretize between to sample points and to integrate the equations. For such a simple method two things have to be kept in mind:
<ul>
<li> The numerical error decreases with decreasing integration step width until the machine accuracy is reached, but the computation time increases as the solution is calculated at more points. </li>
<li> The numerical error increases with greater prediction periods, i.e. the error between model and plant increases between two sampling points. The greater the sampling time, the greater the numerical error. Therefore a smaller sampling time and therewith a more frequent correction makes tuning much easier. However, in most cases you cannot choose the sampling rate as it depends on the speed of your analytic devices. </li>
</ul>

The numerical error plays a role that can be observed when the integration step width is changed from 0.1 to 10. The obtained observer performance is not satisfactory for the same value of the tuning paramter chosen for the integration step width 0.1.
