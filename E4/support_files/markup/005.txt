- The obvious difference between a MHE and an EKF is that constraints can be imposed directly in optimization based state estimators. 

- The MHE uses the full nonlinear model which leads to a better stability behavior of the estimator. 

- The implementation of a MHE requires high effort and its computational cost is also very high. 

- The EKF has a simple implementation hence a low computational cost. 

- A good compromise between both estimators is a CEKF as the implementation effort is comparable with an EKF but still has the advantage that constraints can be used.
