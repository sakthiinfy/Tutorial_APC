Changing the tuning to $Q(2,2)/R(1,1),\,Q(3,3)/R(2,2) > 1$ makes the observer more noisy since it follows the measurements, but still it's performance is quite good.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The numerical method and its integration step width have a direct influence on the estimates. For this reason it is best in theory to use the continuous equations between two samples. This is of course not possible, but one should think about higher order methods to integrate the system.
